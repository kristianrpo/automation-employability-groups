# Branch appointments
Carrying out a correct naming of the branches allows ease in the search of the same and the relationship of these with tasks established in the corresponding backlog.

## Types of branches
In the same idea of the conventional commits, the naming of the branch will depend on the intentionality of the change in the code of the branch. 

- **feat:** A new feature or functionality.
- **fix:** A bug fixed.
- **refactor:** A code change that neither corrects a bug nor adds a feature.
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (blank spaces, formatting, missing semicolons, etc).
- **test:** Add missing tests or correct existing tests.
- **docs:** Changes in documentation.
- **reverts:** Reverts a previous commit
- **build:** Changes that affect the compilation system or external dependencies (e.g. changes in package.json).

## Create branch

For the naming of the branches, the following structure is followed:

    git branch [type-of-branch]/[number-of-task]-[task]

## Example
    branch: feat/2402-detail-user
